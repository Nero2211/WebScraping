# WebScraping

Someone mentioned Web Scraping to me and became interested straight away in creating a script to do the same.<br>
Out of interest, I picked a random website (motivational website in this case - https://www.brainyquote.com/topics/motivational) and targeted my scraping website towards it.
<br>
To make things more challenging and interesting, I decided to save that data scraped from the website over to the MongoDB residing on MLABS domain. Very interesting implementation process and learnt how it's possible to implement this scraping script on any website. <br>
<br>"Any data you see on a website is scrapable!"
